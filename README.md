# Hi! I'm Isela Reyes Perdomo a front end Developer :)

I present you my portfolio, where you can know me a little bit more, check my previous works and contact me.

Currently looking for a job as a Front End in a company where we can build amazing things together. 

I'm a fast learner, easygoing person, team worker and animal lover. 

## Tools
* I used Create React App to make this portfolio.
* FontAwesome for the icons. 

Pd: I check/use [this](https://codepen.io/kylojen/pen/VxXXNm) for the paws animations, and just change a few details.
